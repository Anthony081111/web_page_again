<p>
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are
positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for
different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>

<p1>
Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements
within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text
elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!</p1>

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
<br>
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
<br>
Internal - by using a >style> element in the >head> section
<br>
External - by using a >link> element to link to an external CSS file
<br></p><p1>
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element and  uses the style attribute of an HTML
element.
<br>
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.  An internal CSS is defined in the >head>
section of an HTML page, within a >style> element.
<br>
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.  To use an external style sheet, add a
link to it in the >head> section of each HTML page.
