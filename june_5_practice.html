Chesapeake Bay - Wikipedia



The Chesapeake Bay (/ˈtʃɛsəpiːk/ CHESS-ə-peek) is the largest estuary in the United States.

    The Bay is located in the Mid-Atlantic region and is primarily separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Delmarva

    Peninsula (including the parts: the Eastern Shore of Maryland / Eastern Shore of Virginia and the state of Delaware)

    with its mouth of the Bay at the south end located between Cape Henry and Cape Charles.[3] With its northern

    portion in Maryland and the southern part in Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay is a very important feature for the

    ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others surrounding within its watershed. More than 150 major

    rivers and streams flow into the Bay's 64,299-square-mile (166,534 km2) drainage basin, which covers parts of six

    states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) and all of Washington, D.C.[3][4]
<br></p1>

The Bay is approximately 200 miles (320 km) long from its northern headwaters in the Susquehanna River to its outlet

    in the Atlantic Ocean. It is 2.8 miles (4.5 km) wide at its narrowest (between Kent County's Plum Point near

    Newtown in the east and the Harford County western shore near Romney Creek) and 30 miles (48 km) at its widest

    (just south of the mouth of the Potomac River which divides Maryland from Virginia). Total shoreline including

   tributaries is 11,684 miles (18,804 km), circumnavigating a surface area of 4,479 square miles (11,601 km2).

    Average depth is 21 feet (6.4 m), reaching a maximum of 174 feet (53 m).[5] The Bay is spanned twice, in Maryland

    by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Sandy Point (near Annapolis) to Kent Island and in Virginia by the Chesapeake

    Bay Bridge–Tunnel connecting Virginia Beach to Cape Charles.

Known for both its beauty and bounty, the Bay has become "emptier", with fewer crabs, oysters and watermen (fishermen)

since the mid-20th century.[6] Nutrient pollution and urban runoff have been identified as major components of impaired

water quality in the bay stressing ecosystems and compounding the decline of shellfish due to overharvesting. Restoration

efforts that began in the 1990s have continued into the 21st century and show potential for growth of the native oyster

population.[7][8] The health of the Chesapeake Bay improved in 2015, marking three years of gains over a four-year period,

according to a 2016 report by the University of Maryland.[9] The bay is experiencing other environmental concerns, including

climate change which is causing sea level rise that erodes coastal areas and infrastructure and changes to the marine

ecosystem.[10] These changes have already changed the coastline eroding islands like Holland Island or Long Island

and threatening local infrastructure and economies
